# Kotlin console example

- My First Project with Kotlin

This project will introduce you to Hyperskill projects.
Practice Kotlin coding to build a program that can automate your account management routine.

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built.
Here’s what awaits you:

### Stage (1/3): Print the prices

- Introduction to Kotlin
- Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
- Writing first program
- Standard output

#### Theory

Welcome to your first Kotlin project! On Hyperskill, a project is a practical task where you apply skills from theoretical topics.
Each project is a complete application: a game, a search engine, etc.
To help you grasp the idea, let's write a simple net income calculator in this one!

This is the first stage in the project, a step in its development.
For example, you can't create a Tetris game in one take; instead, break down the task into smaller steps — designing a game board or a menu.
The same applies to our projects; each consists of multiple stages.

Below, you will find a description that provides context for what you should do.
Objectives state the main task of the stage and the details.

Write your code in the Code Editor below and press Run Solution to check it.
If your solution is correct, move to the second stage by pressing Continue.

#### Description

You've recently opened a new corner shop.
It is relatively small; it contains only bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, milk chocolate, doughnuts, and pancakes.
The first version of the program will display a list of all the products with their prices.

#### Objectives

- Print the Prices: line;
- Print the item names and prices from the Example below. Your output format should follow it.

#### Example

**Example 1:** output at the end of this stage

```console
Prices:
Bubblegum: $2
Toffee: $0.2
Ice cream: $5
Milk chocolate: $4
Doughnut: $2.5
Pancake: $3.2
```
