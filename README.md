# Kotlin console example

- My First Project with Kotlin

This project will introduce you to Hyperskill projects.
Practice Kotlin coding to build a program that can automate your account management routine.

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built.
Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

## Stage (1/3): Print the prices

- Introduction to Kotlin
- Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
- Writing first program
- Standard output

## Stage (2/3): Measuring total income

- Values and variables
- Constants and val variables
- Data types
- Arithmetic operations
- Properties of basic types

### Theory

Each new stage of a project is a step up in difficulty. The main idea, however, remains the same. You need to take your code from the first stage and add new features. Find the description of these features below.

### Description

A month has passed since the opening of your shop. Let's calculate the total earnings for this period! You know the total earned amount for each item:

| Item name | Earned amount |
| --- | --- |
| Bubblegum | $202 |
| Toffee | $118 |
| Ice cream | $2250 |
| Milk chocolate| $1680 |
| Doughnut | $1075 |
| Pancake | $80 |

Use this information to find the total income for the first month.

### Objectives

In this stage, your program should:

1. Print the `Earned amount:` line.
2. Print the item names and the earned amount for each item.
3. Print the total earnings as shown below. Replace `0.0` with the actual total sum:

```console
Income: $0.0
```

### Example

**Example 1:** output at the end of this stage (*figures may vary*)

```console
Earned amount:
Bubblegum: $202
Toffee: $118
Ice cream: $2250
Milk chocolate: $1680
Doughnut: $1075
Pancake: $80

Income: $7777
```
